# Fractional Indexing in Kotlin

Based on [Implementing Fractional Indexing](https://observablehq.com/@dgreensp/implementing-fractional-indexing) by [David Greenspan](https://github.com/dgreensp).

This port is based on the [rocicorp/fractional-indexing](https://github.com/rocicorp/fractional-indexing) repo and is meant to give the same output for any given input, but no guarantees are made that this port is 100% accurate to the original JavaScript source code it was ported from.

This is compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform as it makes use of only the Kotlin standard library (no JVM-specific code).

# Acknowledgements

[rocicorp](https://github.com/rocicorp) for the original code implemented in JavaScript, located at https://github.com/rocicorp/fractional-indexing, and ported to Kotlin in this repo.
